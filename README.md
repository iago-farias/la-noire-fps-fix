# L.A. Noire fps fix
The game by default locks the framerate to 30, this script overrides a value in the game process to unlock 60fps.

The ReadWriteMemory.py file was removed from this [repository](https://github.com/vsantiago113/ReadWriteMemory), with the addition of two functions readFloat and writeFloat.

# Usage
With the game running, run the code below:

```
python main.py
```
